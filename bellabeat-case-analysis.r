Everyone knows that the way to lose weight is burning more calories than you eat. According to the analysis of this dataset, women who have more minutes of high activity tend to burn more calories while exercising for a shorter period of time.\n\nWith this insight, Bellabeat can opt to create a marketing campaign focusing on having a high-intensity workout, specially for busy women. Customers who were attracted by the products and followed that tip would likely see better results and be satisfied with the purchase.\n\nThe other trend found is that sleeping time and sedentary time are closely related. As sleep is much needed in order to have a nice and healthy appearance, Bellabeat products could have a certain focus on improving sleeping schedules with things like reminders and nighttime modes.\n\n### In short:\n\n* Marketing campaigns focusing on the idea that to lose weight, it is probably a good idea to have a time for high-intensity movement.\n* Implementation and advertising of sleep-inducing features to reduce sedentary time through the day, improving active hours.\n\n\n\n\n## **Wrap Up**\n**Thank you** for reading through my Bellabeat case Study!\nThis is my first data analysis project and the capstone for my google career certificate.\nMake sure to upvote this notebook and leave any comments or questions :)","metadata":{"_uuid":"5b9c8944-3048-4640-8e1c-07dd3969492b","_cell_guid":"a20a2923-35df-4fb4-a1f3-c6f49d758812","trusted":true}}]}
